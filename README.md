This project seeks to develop a comprehensive exotic options pricing toolkit using the binomial tree framework, focusing on advanced derivative securities that exhibit complex payoff structures beyond standard European and American options. The system is designed to price four distinct categories of path-dependent and multi-asset derivatives, each offering unique risk-return profiles for sophisticated financial engineering applications.
The toolkit encompasses Barrier options that activate or terminate when the underlying asset price crosses predetermined threshold levels, providing cost-effective hedging alternatives with conditional payoff structures. These knock-in and knock-out features make barrier options particularly attractive for investors seeking targeted exposure with reduced premium costs compared to vanilla options.
Chooser options represent a flexible derivative instrument that grants holders the right to designate the option as either a call or put at a specified future date, combining elements of both option types into a single contract. This delayed decision-making capability allows investors to defer their directional bets until more market information becomes available, effectively purchasing optionality on optionality itself.
The system also prices Rainbow options, which are multi-asset derivatives that base their payoffs on the best-performing or worst-performing asset from a basket of underlying securities. These contracts enable investors to capture relative performance across multiple assets, making them valuable tools for portfolio optimization and cross-asset allocation strategies.
Finally, Spread options provide exposure to the price differential between two correlated assets, generating payoffs based on whether the spread exceeds a predetermined strike level. These derivatives are extensively used in commodities markets, pairs trading strategies, and relative value arbitrage, where profit opportunities arise from convergence or divergence of related asset prices.
Each pricing engine within the toolkit generates exhaustive stock price paths over discrete time intervals using multiplicative up and down factors. The system calculates risk-neutral probabilities to ensure arbitrage-free pricing, determines terminal payoffs according to each derivative's specific contractual features, and discounts expected values back to present terms using the risk-free rate
